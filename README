phpMyStuff

phpMyStuff (pms) is a LAMP based web application allowing facebook 
style activity for its users on ones own server, but with a twist.

Whilst allowing to share multimedia as well as any other managed 
contents and networking users in circles, it can also connect to other
instances of this application and exchange data. For example, user A
runs this app for himself and his friends. A friend, lets call him 66,
also runs this app for himself and is also a friend of user A.
Now either one can add the friend as usual but ticking a box that this 
friend has their own instance, it will then connect the two sites 
together and exchange data so that either side can see the activities of
their counter part as if they were one the same site.
