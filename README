kohana32_useradmin

I have created this project to be able to seperately 
maintain a base install of kohana 3.2 with useradmin 
that I can then use as a basis for other applications.

Using the base as a seperate project allows me to merge
in any bugfixes or upgrades into one single repo and
then pull them into the other projects where needed.

Currently, this project consists of the following:

kohana 3.2
mixu's useradmin module with mods to run in ko32
mixu's i18n class to record language strings (handy during development) with mods to run in ko32
shadowhand's pagination class with mods to run in ko32
shadowhand's purifier class with mods to run in ko32
